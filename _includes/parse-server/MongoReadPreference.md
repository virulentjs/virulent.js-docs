# Using MongoDB Read Preference
As of ParseServer 2.5, it is possible to set a read preference for Mongo DB queries.   For a discussion of Read Preference, limitations and use cases, see the [Mongo documentation for Read Preference.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/).

## How to set Read Preference in ParseServer
Currently, read preference can only be set in cloud code.  For an example see: [cloud code examples](../../cloudcode/guide#examples)
