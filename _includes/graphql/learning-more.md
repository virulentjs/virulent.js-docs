If you look at the right side of your GraphQL Playground, you will see the DOCS and SCHEMA menus. They are automatically generated by analyzing your application schema and contain all operations that you can call for your application, including the automatic class queries and mutations. Please refer to them and learn more about everything that you can do with your Parse GraphQL API.

Additionally, the [GraphQL Learn Section](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a very good source to start learning about the power of the GraphQL language.
