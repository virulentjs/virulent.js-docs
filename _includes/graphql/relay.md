# Relay

The Parse Server GraphQL API follows latest standards currently available for highly-scalable APIs and ambitious front-end projects.

The Parse Open Source Team choose to follow the [GraphQL Server Relay Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/en/graphql-server-specification).

Relay is a JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications powered by GraphQL, designed from the ground up to be easy to use, extensible and, most of all, performant. Relay accomplishes this with static queries and ahead-of-time code generation.

Later we will see some Relay concepts like: Node, Connection and Cursor.
