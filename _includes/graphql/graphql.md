# GraphQL

Before continuing, it is recommended to study some of the GraphQL documentation:

A GraphQL API contains 3 main concepts:
* `Query`: Fetch data
* `Mutation`: Create or update data
* `Subscription`: Listen for data changes

## Learn Query & Mutation
To learn how to query data and execute operation on a GraphQL API [consult the official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).
